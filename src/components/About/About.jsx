        <p>
          I am a Mechanical Engineering masterâ€™s graduate who has always been a
          keen problem-solver. While studying, I enjoyed collaborating on
          numerous group design projects and realised the tangible impact of
          code through learning Matlab.  
        </p>
        <p>
        This sparked my interest to pursue further self-learning with Python and subsequently Join the Bright
          Network Full-Stack Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have continued to improve my skills and I now wish to be a software engineer with an organisation that holds
        collaboration and self-development as values.
